# An update on AngularDart

The AngularDart project is now in maintenance mode for users outside of Google, as we
[announced in May 2021](https://medium.com/dartlang/angulardart-flutter-and-the-web-spring-update-f7f5b8b10001).
At this time, we are not accepting new external issues or pull requests, however
we will continue to monitor for high-severity security issues, which can be
reported at https://dart.dev/security.

# AngularDart development has transitioned to the `angulardart-community` project

The AngularDart team at Google has transitioned the maintenance of the
AngularDart project to the [`angulardart-community` project](https://github.com/angulardart-community).
We will no longer accept issues or pull requests on the current repo, which has
been archived to avoid confusion.

The project was originally maintained by the AngularDart team at Google, but due
to a shift to prioritize internal usage of AngularDart and increased emphasis on
Flutter's web support, we
[in 2021 asked for community contributors](https://medium.com/dartlang/angulardart-flutter-and-the-web-spring-update-f7f5b8b10001)
that might be interested in taking over AngularDart. We're very happy that the
angulardart-community has come forward to take over the maintenance of
AngularDart.

For more details about the angulardart-community project, see 
[their roadmap issue](https://github.com/angulardart-community/angular/issues/6).

For developers excited to use Dart & Flutter for building new apps for the Web,
we'd encourage you to look at [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/web).

Thank you for [your support](https://github.com/angulardart/angular/issues/1976).
It means a lot to us!
